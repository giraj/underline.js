        <h1 class='underline'>Underline.js</h1>

        <p>Underline.js is used as a more flexible, customizable underline. With it, you can specify characters not to underline, as seen in the heading, and other features such as line-width, margin, color.</p>

        <p>This doesn't work really if the text spans several lines between "break-characters" (g, y, etc.) due to how this is done. Could be fixed, but I am <span class='punderline'>not working</span> on it. </p>

        <p>However, for single-lined titles it works. It would be nice to be able to specify "spacing" or "padding" around certain letters, f.ex. the 'q' can be quite spacious from the left-side when using this. </p>

        <p>The docs are the README on <a class='aunderline' href='http://github.com/jarlg/underline.js'>github</a>, so head over there 

        <p>If there are any <span class='punderline'>questions</span> feel free to ask me on <a class='aunderline' href='http://github.com/jarlg'>@jarlg</a>.</p>
